      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>
        By using Ocht, you agree to use the service responsibly and understand
        that reports are training guidance, not medical advice.
      </p>

      <h2>Race Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Ocht uses deterministic calculations based on the splits and targets
        you enter. Results are estimates and should be interpreted alongside
        your own coaching, recovery, health, and race context.
      </p>

      <h2>Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for keeping your login details secure. Do not use
        another person&apos;s account or attempt to access reports that are not
        yours.
      </p>

      <h2>Paid Features</h2>
      <p>
        Ocht premium unlocks full report sections, export actions, saved account
        workflows, and related premium features shown in the product. Billing is
        processed by Stripe.
      </p>

      <h2>Availability</h2>
      <p>
        Ocht may change as features are improved. We aim to keep the service
        available, but downtime, maintenance, or third-party outages can happen.
      </p>
