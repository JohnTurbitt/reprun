      <h1>Refunds and Cancellation</h1>
      <p>
        Paid subscriptions are managed through Stripe. Signed-in customers can
        open the billing portal from the account panel to cancel or manage their
        subscription.
      </p>

      <h2>Cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        You can cancel through the Stripe billing portal. Access remains tied to
        the subscription status Stripe sends to Ocht through webhook events.
      </p>

      <h2>Refund Requests</h2>
      <p>
        If you believe a payment was made in error, contact support with the
        account email and payment date. Refunds are reviewed case by case.
      </p>

      <h2>Billing Problems</h2>
      <p>
        If payment fails or becomes past due, Stripe may retry payment and
        Ocht may restrict paid features until the subscription is active
        again.
      </p>
